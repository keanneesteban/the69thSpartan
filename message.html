                It doth occur to me that the manner in which I commit these words to parchment may not be the grandest
                orchestration that mine intentions had initially orchestrated. Yet, in light of the great span that
                separates our dwellings, this letter must suffice!
                <br>
                <br>
                Methinks the most cherished facet of our bond is its steadfast endurance throughout the passing years,
                like a beacon unwavering in the night's sky. During the opening decade of my sojourn within the land of
                the United States, we were as kin inseparable. To thee, I owe a debt of gratitude for much of the
                composition of my being.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thou hast been the tutor of board games and the instructor in the art of card games. Countless are the
                battles fought together in the realm of video games. The art of football found its introduction to my
                understanding through thee. Beyond these deeds, thou hast bestowed upon me tokens of thy
                affection in the form of pasulubongs and souvenirs gathered from distant lands. Ah, New York! 'Twas a
                time of joy when we did convene there.
                <br>
                <br>
                Verily, thou hast endowed me with great abundance, and my heart swells with gratitude everlasting. To
                proclaim thee as family brings me great joy. I dare to dream that thou mightest consider the role of a
                groomsman at the impending occasion of my nuptials. Pray, let thy response be in the affirmative, though
                a jesting smile shapes my lips as I pen this request. reach me at thy earliest convenience to share
                thine answer.
                <br>
                <br>
                With affection unbounded,
                <br>
                <br>
                Keo Syndulla,
                <br>
                Thy kin and companion
